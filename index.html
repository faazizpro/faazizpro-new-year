                <h2>My failures of previous year</h2>
                <p>
                    In the past year, my failures as a web developer taught me important lessons. I underestimated the significance of thorough testing, resulting in post-launch bugs. Lack of collaboration skills affected teamwork, and neglecting to stay updated with tech trends hindered innovation. These experiences highlight areas for improvement in the coming year.
